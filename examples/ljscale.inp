MONOMERS
# name   charge   dipole_moment   polarizability
# +/- in name will be striped
# For monomers without charge and dipole, polarizability is optional, which will not be used
# These values are just examples, for real application, one could calculate dipole and polarizability using QM methods

ATOMS
# monomer atoms_belong_to_this_monomer
# The scaling factor between atoms will be set to the scaling factor between monomers which atoms belong to
# For example, the scaling factor between CT-CT is set to  the scaling factor of C4H10-C4H10 dimer,
# the scaling factor between HC-N3A is set to the scaling factor of C4H10-dca dimer.
